            <p><u>Disease  outbreaks</u><br />The most reported disease problems in cattle in Uganda  include East Coast fever (ECF), anaplasmosis, babesiosis, trypanosomiasis, Foot and mouth disease (FMD)  affecting the main source of diary products that take up a big chunk of the animal rearing systems in Uganda </p>

            <p><u>Ignorance of farmers</u><br />many farmers in Uganda are not properly educated on the new practices in farming which cause them to produce very low yields as a result of using there outdated systems</p>

            <p><u>Inadequate capital</u><br />Agriculture in Uganda is largely affected by the inability of farmers to acquire adequate capital to purchase the labour and machinery that  can help them make farming more efficient thus them using old equipment like hoes </p>

            <p><u>Poor security</u> <br />Areas in Uganda that specialize in cattle rearing such as Karamoja face a serious issue of cattle rustlings which prevents them from carrying out farming to an efficient level as they are always fighting for there cattle</p>

            <p><u>Low market purchasing power</u> <br /> the inability of the public to provide a market to the agricultural sector to buy and sell there yields at premium prices so as to earn high profits has discouraged famers from expanding there farming practices  which has blocked the sector from developing  </p>

            <p><u>Dependence of farmers on nature </u> <br />most farmers in Uganda depend on nature for things like watering of plants through rain which is not reliable and has resulted into whole sectors of agriculture such as production of maize slowing down as a result of dry seasons or unreliable weather </p>
